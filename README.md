Dataset Description
  The Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) Project monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, counts, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day.

Potential Interesting Questions:

  What different attribute values show up in news for the longest amount of time after their occurance?
  
    Ex: Do negative events stay on the news longer than positive events? Does protest coverage last longer or shorter than violence coverage?
